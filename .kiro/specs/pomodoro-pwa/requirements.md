# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pomodoro PWA is a productivity application that implements the Pomodoro Technique - a time management method that uses focused work sessions (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. The application will be built as a Progressive Web App using React, allowing users to install it on any device and use it offline. The app will provide timer functionality, session tracking, and customizable settings to help users maintain focus and productivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start and control Pomodoro timer sessions, so that I can follow the Pomodoro Technique for better productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the start button THEN the system SHALL begin a 25-minute countdown timer
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL display the remaining time in MM:SS format
3. WHEN the user clicks the pause button THEN the system SHALL pause the current timer
4. WHEN the user clicks the resume button THEN the system SHALL continue the paused timer
5. WHEN the user clicks the reset button THEN the system SHALL reset the timer to its initial state
6. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL play a notification sound and display a completion message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic break timers after work sessions, so that I can follow the complete Pomodoro cycle without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a work session completes THEN the system SHALL automatically start a 5-minute short break timer

5. IF the user manually skips a break THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next work session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize timer durations, so that I can adapt the technique to my personal preferences and work requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL allow modification of work session duration (5-60 minutes)
2. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL allow modification of short break duration (1-15 minutes)
3. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL allow modification of long break duration (5-30 minutes)
4. WHEN the user changes timer settings THEN the system SHALL save these preferences locally
5. WHEN the user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL use the custom durations if set

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my completed sessions, so that I can monitor my productivity and maintain motivation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a work session THEN the system SHALL increment the daily session counter
2. WHEN the user views the statistics THEN the system SHALL display today's completed sessions
3. WHEN the user views the statistics THEN the system SHALL display the current streak of consecutive days with completed sessions
4. WHEN the user completes sessions THEN the system SHALL store the completion data locally
5. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL reset the daily counter but maintain historical data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the app on my device, so that I can access it quickly without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the app in a compatible browser THEN the system SHALL display an install prompt
2. WHEN the user clicks install THEN the system SHALL add the app to their device's home screen/app drawer
3. WHEN the user opens the installed app THEN the system SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the app is installed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate app icons and metadata
5. IF the device supports it THEN the system SHALL enable the app to be launched from the device's app launcher

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline, so that I can use it even without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has no internet connection THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN the app loads for the first time THEN the system SHALL cache all necessary resources
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL display an offline indicator
4. WHEN the user's connection is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any pending data if applicable
5. WHEN the app updates THEN the system SHALL handle service worker updates gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want audio and visual notifications, so that I know when sessions and breaks are complete even when not actively looking at the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timer completes THEN the system SHALL play a configurable notification sound
2. WHEN a timer completes THEN the system SHALL show a browser notification if permissions are granted
3. WHEN the user grants notification permissions THEN the system SHALL send notifications even when the app is not in focus

5. IF the browser supports it THEN the system SHALL request notification permissions on first use

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on my work without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a minimalist interface with clear timer display
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL show visual progress indication
3. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
